# pewlett-hackard-analysis


## Overview of the analysis
* Pewlett Hackard (PH) is a big company with several hundred of thousands of employees and it's preparing for the future in a couple of ways as a wave of baby boomers prepare to retire. 

The goal is to find out:
1. Determine the number of retiring employees per title.
2. Identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

> For doing so we have modeled the company's available databases and with the help of SQL queries we expect to get valuable information

## Summary: 

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
From the third bullet point we can see that 7 positions are affected of which of which more than 2 thirds are senior staff and senior engineers and a very small fraction of managers and assistant engineers  2% and 1% respectively.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Given that most of the most expirienced workers are leaving the company means that PH has to beging filling up those positions.

### Two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

1. Number of emloyees elegible for mentorship is 1549.

![query_4_c](https://github.com/IrvingHdez/pewlett-hackard-analysis/blob/main/Analysis%20Projects/Pewlett-Hackard%20Analysis/Images/query_4_c.PNG)

An interesting point is that just aroun 1500 are elegible for mentorship whereas 72,458 employees are going to retire. That's a huge disparity.
